website
=============================

This repository hosts the Web page for the University of Maryland Libraries Coding Workshop.

We will be using the repository's wiki as the Web site.

The home page is published at https://github.com/umd-coding-workshop/website/wiki 

You can also get to the wiki by clicking on the wiki link in the right side navigation bar.

Edit the wiki by going to a page and clicking edit. 

Edit the wiki's sidebar by first editing any page--the box for editing the sidebar should appear below the editing box for the main content.

Files that make the wiki strangely don't show up as a Github repository, but they're there. You can see them by going to the wiki, clicking Clone URL, and using that URL to clone a local repository. Or maybe I'm missing something.
-------

The Web site for the group was originally set us as HTML pages using Github pages. That version of the Web site is stored in the gh-pages branch.

That Web site lives at http://umd-coding-workshop.github.io/website. It now redirects to the wiki.
